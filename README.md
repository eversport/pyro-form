# Pyro-Form

Pyro-Form is a fast and simple form manager that helps you with managing the state of components in a form. It's also unbelievably small and has **ZERO** external dependencies. Give it a try!

## Why use Pyro-Form

Compact, simple and fast state management in react is hard. Pyro-Form takes away all the worries while still allowing you to hook into every process you want. I allows you to build forms fast, keeps overhead minimal and makes maintainability a breeze. 

You probably think now "Ok I get why I need to use a form manager. But why should I use Pyro-Form and not one of the others out there?"

1) **Pyro form is small** (and in the JS world size does matter) - Since Pyro-Form was built with the overall package size in mind it has zero external dependencies which makes it so small (2kb gzipped ðŸ˜±).

Compared to the most popular form management libraries for react:

| | Redux-Form | Formik | React-Form | Pyro-Form |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Minified** | 117.5kB | 39.7kB | 113.1kB | **6kB** |
| **Minified+Gzipped** | 27.4kB | 11.4kB | 30.1kB | **2kB** |

2) **Simple API** - Why make it hard when it can be so easy? The API provides you with all necessary hooks you are used to while not making you worry about them if you don't want to. Also the Field Wrapper Component will allow you to make your components reuseable and easy-to-use with almost no changes to your current codebase.  

3) **100% built in Typescript** - Almost everything is strictly typed. This not only makes it easier for us to provide high-quality and maintainable code for you, but also allows you to use our typings to make your code better.
